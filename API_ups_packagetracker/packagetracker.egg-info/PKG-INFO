        Credits
        ============
        
        Much of this library is based on `packagetrack`_ initially by Scott Torborg.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        This package is not published to PyPi, so grab the source and do ``pip install .`` in this directory, or use ``setup.py``.
        
        Example
        =======
        
        >>> import packagetracker
        >>> tracker = packagetracker.PackageTracker()
        >>> package = tracker.package('1Z9999999999999999')
        # Identify packages:
        >>> package.shipper
        'UPS'
        # Track packages:
        >>> info = package.track()
        >>> print info.status
        IN TRANSIT TO
        >>> print info.delivery_date
        2010-06-25 00:00:00
        >>> print info.last_update
        2010-06-19 00:54:00
        # Get tracking URLs (UPS, FedEx, and USPS):
        >>> print package.url()
        http://wwwapps.ups.com/WebTracking/processInputRequest?TypeOfInquiryNumber=T&InquiryNumber1=1Z9999999999999999
        
        
        API Configuration
        =====================
        
        To enable package tracking, get an account for each of the services you wish
        to use, and then make a file at ~/.config/packagetrack that looks like::
        
            [UPS]
            license_number = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
            user_id = XXXX
            password = XXXX
        
            [FedEx]
            key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
            password = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
            account_number = #########
            meter_number = #########
        
            [USPS]
            userid = XXXXXXXXXXXX
            password = XXXXXXXXXXXX
        
        
        For USPS, the optional argument 'server' can be set to 'test' or 'production'.
        
        Status
        =======
        
        Currently the UPS and USPS interfaces work... mostly well.  I'm sure there are
        weird edge cases everywhere, there's a lot of documentation to read, not all of
        it good.
        
        The FedEx interface is a little broken, I'm not sure if it's the
        `python-fedex`_ that isn't fetching the right information from the API, or the
        API just not returning useful tracking, but right now, you get basically
        nothing.
